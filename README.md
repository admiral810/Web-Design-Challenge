# Movies Genre Impact on Box Office

## Webpage
This is a webpage that hosts results from analysis complete on movies.  Data was analyzed in python, with vizualizations created using matplotlib.

## Findings
This project was complete to analyze if critic scores had correlation to box office success over the past 20 years. The hypothesis was that critic score relationship to box office success varied based on movie genre.

Movies with a family, sci-fi, action, or adventure genre have a higher relationship of box office success when receiving higher critic scores.

Genres like romance and comedy have a much lower correlation of critic score to box office success. Perhaps other factors matter more for these films (Ex: actors, budget, etc).
